Singleton Design Pattern
Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

There are two forms of singleton design pattern

Early Instantiation: creation of instance at load time.
Lazy Instantiation: creation of instance when required.
Advantage of Singleton design pattern
Saves memory because object is not created at each request. Only single instance is reused again and again.
Usage of Singleton design pattern
Singleton pattern is mostly used in multi-threaded and database applications. It is used in logging, caching, thread pools, configuration settings etc.
