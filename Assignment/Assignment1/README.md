# Government Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (GEAFs)

Government Enterprise Architecture is defined as a whole of government approach to support government ecosystems by transcending boundaries for delivering services in a coordinated, efficient, and equitable manner.

Many governments are revitalizing public administration, overhauling public management, fostering inclusive leadership, and moving their public services to become more efficient, transparent, and accountable. This turning Government Enterprise Architecture to bridge policies and outcomes for better services.

The Open Group Government EA Work Group has been established to help government organizations through the development and sharing of best practices that focused on developing standards and best practices relating to the world-wide use of Enterprise Architecture (EA) in government organizations.

Government Enterprise consists of a coordinated set of activity areas involving one or more public organizations and possibly third-party entities from private organizations or civil society.

A government-wide enterprise architecture will allow the government to reduce the costs of development and operations, while at the same time improving overall quality, by promoting interoperability and reuse of standard components. The objectives of the GEA framework are to assist in the delivery of more consistent, cohesive and efficient digital services to citizens by the government, through providing a framework that:

* provides a common language for agencies involved in the delivery of cross-agency services enhances collaboration.
* supports the identification of re-usable and shareable services and applications.
* assists in describing and analyzing IT investments.
* provides a basis for the objective review of investment by government.
* guides our transformation towards a coherent digital government.

The GEA framework comprises eight documents as described below:

1. Architectural Framework: Provides a high-level overview of all of below Architecture and Standards documents as well as guides agencies on how to apply them.

2. Business Reference Model: Defines a Business architecture framework and associated standards providing guidance on how new business services should be modeled, defined, developed, monitored and continuously improved throughout the service lifecycle.

3. Information Reference Model: Describes the Information exchange architecture approach and standards for sharing information data sets across government agencies.

4. Application Reference Model: Describes the Application reference architecture and standards to be used to create applications supporting Government services.

5. Infrastructure Reference Model: Describes the Infrastructure reference architecture and standards that will be the foundation for building application components and business services.

6. Security Management: Provides the GEA context to the related security and privacy requirements for government agencies.

7. Service Management: Defines the framework for managing IT services that are required to support the delivered services.

8. Governance Model: Defines the architecture governance framework to ensure effective adoption and evolution of reference architecture models across all the agencies in Government.
