Agile Methodologies
The agile methodology is one of the easiest software solutions. The agile method is an iterative and incremental tactic to software design that utilizes constant planning, understanding, upgrading, team partnership, development, and delivery.

Driven by the principles of providing value and collaborating with stakeholders, the agile methodology originates with customers defining the end uses of the final product and the kind of problems the final product attempts to address. This exercise helps in resolving and clarifying the customer’s anticipations and requirements for the project development team.

Types:
Kanban
Originating from the Japanese language, the translation of the word ‘Kanban’ is “visual board or signboard” and is connected to the concept of “just in time”! Initially, the Kanban concept was introduced as a lean manufacturing system and slowly drove its way to agile software development teams. This method uses visual methods for developing and managing projects.

Projects through Kanban are overseen with the help of the Kanban Board, which is divided into columns to depict the process flow of the software development. This helps in increasing visibility teams as the teams can see the progress through every stage of development and prepare for the upcoming tasks to deliver the product “just in time”!

This method requires thorough interaction and transparency to enable the team members to be equipped with the right stage of development at any time and have a cohesive flow of work at all times

Scrum
One of the most popular agile methodology examples is the agile scrum development methodology, which is depicted by various cycles of development. Similar to Kanban, Scrum breaks down the development phases into stages or cycles called ‘sprints’. The development time for each sprint is maximized and dedicated, thereby managing only one sprint at a time.

Scrum and agile methodologies focus on continuous deliverables, and thus this method lets designers adjust priorities to ensure that any incomplete or overdue sprints get more attention.

Scrum Team has exclusive project roles such as a scrum master and a product owner with constant communications on the daily scrum where the activities are harmonized to devise the best way to implement the sprint.

Extreme Programming (XP)
Extreme Programming (XP) is a methodology that emphasizes teamwork, communication, and feedback. It focuses on constant development and customer satisfaction. Similar to scrum, this method also uses sprints or short development cycles. This is developed by a team to create a productive and highly efficient environment.

Extreme Programming technique is very supportive in a situation of constant and varying demands from the customers. It motivates the developers to accept changes in the customer’s demands, even if they pop-up in an advanced phase of the development process.

In Extreme Programming, the project is tested from the initial stages by collecting feedback that progresses the output of the system. This also presents a spot check to implement easily any customer requirements.

Crystal
Introduced by Mr. Alistair Cockburn, one of the monumental persons in formulating the Agile manifesto for software development, Crystal is a group of smaller agile development methodologies comprising of Crystal Yellow, Crystal Clear, Crystal Red, Crystal Orange, and more. Each has its peculiar and exclusive framework that is characterized by factors such as system criticality, team size, and project priorities. Depending on the nature of the project or system criticality such as Comfort (C), Essential Money (E), Discretionary Money (D), and Life (L), the kind of crystal agile methodology is chosen.

Similar to other methodologies of Agile, Crystal also addresses prompt delivery of software, regularity, less administration with high involvement of users, and customer satisfaction. The Crystal family advocates that each system or project is inimitable and necessitates the solicitation of diverse practices, processes, and policies to achieve the best results, earning the name of the most lightweight methods of agile methodology.

Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
To address the need for a standard industry charter for the swift delivery of software, the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) was developed. DSDM gives a comprehensive structure that is defined and modified to create a plan, execute, manage, and scale the procedure of software development. Based on a business-driven approach and eight principles, the DSDM believes that modifications to the project are always expected, and quality with timely delivery must never be negotiated.
